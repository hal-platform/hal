    <h3>I would like to deploy my application with HAL 9000. What do I need to do?</h3>
    <p>Minimum requirements.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The project files must be on the <a href="http://git">Github Enterprise</a> server.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>After making sure that your project meets the minimum requirements above, gather the information below.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Determine what group your application should exist in within HAL 9000. This is commonly a team or business
            area name. You can see the ones that already exist by looking at the <a href="{{ urlFor('groups') }}">Groups Page</a>.
            If you need to create a new group, you'll need the following information.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A short name with no spaces or special characters. Examples include 'venture', 'servicing', and
                    'webcore'.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A fill name that described your group. Examples include 'Team Venture', 'Servicing', and 'Web
                    Core'.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Determine the name of your application. You will need both a short name (lowercase, no spaces) and full name.
        </li>
        <li>
            Determine where your application exists within Github. Please provide the Github username or group and the
            repository name.
        </li>
        <li>
            Determine who should be able to build and push your application. By default, HAL 9000 will grant build
            & push permissions for non-production environments to all users who are collaborators on the Github
            repository. If additional people need to be able to build and push, you will need to request that
            LDAP permissions be created.
        </li>
        <li>
            Determine what environments and servers your application will be deployed to. (Example: test1www1, test1beta1, etc)
        </li>
        <li>
            Determine what directory on those servers your application will live in. (Example: /var/www/application)
        </li>
        <li>
            Determine what, if any, command should be used to build your application. This is commonly a shell script
            that lives withing your repository and tells HAL 9000 what should be done prior to pushing your code. It
            must return 0 to indicate success or 1 to indicate failure. When this script is run, it will have access
            to the following environment variables.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <code>HAL_ENVIRONMENT</code>: The environment that your application is being build for, commonly
                    test, beta, or prod.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Determine what, if any, command should be run after deploying your application. This is called a post-push
            command and is commonly used to restart services or finalize a deployment. It must return 0 to indicate
            success and 1 to indicate failure. This command will have access to the following environment variables.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <code>HAL_HOSTNAME</code>: The hostname of the sever your application was pushed to.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>HAL_ENVIRONMENT</code>: The environment that your application was built for, commonly test,
                    beta, or prod.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>HAL_PATH</code>: The path on the server where your application was pushed to.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>HAL_COMMIT</code>: The Git commit hash that was built.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>HAL_GITREF</code>: The Git branch, tag, or pull request name that was built.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>HAL_BUILDID</code>: The unique build ID.
                </li>
            </ul>
            Please note that, when this command is run, your code has already been pushed to the final server. For this
            reason, returning an error state will not stop the push process. If an error occurs, you will need to start
            a new push and overwrite the failed one.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Once your have gathered all of the required information, speak with your team leader and request that the
        application be added to HAL 9000. If your team leader does not have permission to do this, then contact the
        <a href="mailto:WebCore@quickenloans.com">Web Core</a> team and we'll assist you with the process.
