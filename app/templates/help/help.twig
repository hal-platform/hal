    <h3>I would like to deploy my application with HAL 9000. What do I need to do?</h3>
    <p>The project files must be on the <a href="http://git">Github Enterprise</a> server.</p>
    <p>After making sure that your project meets the minimum requirements above, gather the information below.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Determine what group your application should exist in within HAL 9000.</strong>
            <p>
                This is commonly a team or business area name. You can see the ones that already exist by looking
                at the <a href="{{ urlFor('groups') }}">Groups Page</a>. If you need to create a new group, you'll
                need the following information.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        An identifier using numbers, letters, and hyphens. Examples include 'venture', 'servicing', and
                        'web-core'.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The full title that describes your group. Examples include 'Team Venture', 'Servicing', and 'Web
                        Core'.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Determine the name of your application.</strong>
            <p>You will need both an identifier (letters, numbers, hyphens) and full name.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Determine where your application exists within Github.</strong>
            <p>Please provide the Github username or organization and the repository name.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Determine who should be able to build and push your application.</strong>
            <p>
                By default, HAL 9000 will grant build &amp; push permissions for non-production environments to all
                users who are collaborators on the Github repository. If additional people need to be able to build and
                push, you will need to request that LDAP permissions be created.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Determine what environments and servers your application will be deployed to.</strong>
            <p>Examples: test1www1, test1beta1, etc.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Determine what directory on those servers your application will live in.</strong>
            <p>Example: <code>/var/www/application</code></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Determine what, if any, command should be used to build your application.</strong>
            <p>
                This is commonly a shell script that lives withing your repository and tells HAL 9000 what should
                be done prior to pushing your code. Read more about the <a href="{{ urlFor('help.deployment') }}">build scripting environment</a>.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Once your have gathered all of the required information, speak with your team leader and request that the
        application be added to HAL 9000. Contact Key Masters at

        <p>
            Look Dave, I can see you're really upset about this.
