// Scales wouldn't be possible without the amazing work of Harry Roberts (http://csswizardry.com/) on
// Inuit.css (https://github.com/csswizardry/inuit.css). A number of the design patterns and techniques
// in Scales were borrowed from Inuit.css.

// ==========================================================================
// !!! WARNING !!!
// ========================================================================== //
//
// You shouldn't modify anything here, other than commenting out patterns that you don't need.
// Everything here is simplified as much as possible so that you don't have to remove anything.
//
// Scales doesn't make any design decisions for you. To give design to these elements and patterns
// simply create your own partials and extend these styles. I recommend naming your partials the same as
// these for the sake of consistency in your project.
