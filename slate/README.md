# API Documentation

API docs are generated with slate. Slate is a template for creating docs using
the middleman static site generator. These technologies are built in ruby.

# Compiling docs for deployment

Run `bin/slate` to compile API docs.

This script will handle copying files in and out of the container as well as building it
if it does not exist on your system.
